# OPENBOOK


## Description
Hate extensive note taking? Sick of online open book exams with way too much content (thanks coronavirus)?? The solution: Openbook

I actually built this little web app while studying for a course at uni. It was a content-heavy course with a multiple choice online exam. When I started writing out notes I realised there was a lot, and they'd time-constrained the exam such that there wouldn't be much time to flick through notes during the exam. The solution?? An easily searchable, categorised and organised virtual notebook!!! (and a good excuse for procrastination)

## Structure
For the exam, I've just implemented a baseline functionality. Afterwards, I might build it out a bit.
- notebook is stored locally in a json file
- notebook can be loaded to and from redux on the site
- can add, delete, edit notes
- main functionality is the search which searches first by title then by keywords for any notes.
